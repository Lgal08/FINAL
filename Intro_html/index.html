        <h1> Hunger Games </h1>
        <p>In a dystopian future, the nation of Panem is divided into 12 districts and the Capitol. To demonstrate power, the Capitol forces each district to send one boy and one girl, called "tributes," to compete in a brutal televised event known as the Hunger Games. When her younger sister is chosen, Katniss Everdeen volunteers in her place and enters the deadly arena. Alongside her fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark, Katniss must navigate a world of treachery, alliances, and survival, all while facing not only physical challenges but moral dilemmas that could change the course of Panem's future. The film, based on Suzanne Collins' bestselling novel, explores themes of power, sacrifice, and rebellion.</p>

        <h3>Behind the scenes</h3>
        <p>In The Hunger Games movie, Katniss' iconic "Girl on Fire" costume, worn during her chariot ride to the Capitol, was designed to look like it was engulfed in flames. While the flames are digitally added in post-production, the costume itself was actually equipped with real fire elements! The outfit was made with a special fabric that could withstand controlled flames, creating the dramatic effect of Katniss literally being set on fire (safely, of course). This attention to detail helped bring the electrifying look to life and added to the intensity of Katniss' public persona as a symbol of rebellion.</p>
