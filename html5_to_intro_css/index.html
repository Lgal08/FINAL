        <h1>Introduction to The Hunger Games Universe</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the dystopian world of The Hunger Games, the thrilling book series by Suzanne Collins that explores survival, sacrifice, and rebellion. Set in the post-apocalyptic nation of Panem, The Hunger Games follows the story of Katniss Everdeen, a young girl who becomes a symbol of defiance in a society ruled by oppression and fear.
            The series spans three books: The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay, which have been adapted into successful films that captivated millions worldwide. Whether you're new to Panem or a longtime fan, this site will explore the complex themes, characters, and world-building that make The Hunger Games a timeless story.</p>
            <h2>The Setting: Panem and Its Districts</h2>
            <img src="images/hung2.jpeg" alt="hunger2">

            <p>Panem is divided into 12 districts, each specializing in a particular industry, from agriculture to mining. The Capitol, an opulent city filled with excess and power, controls the entire nation with an iron fist. Every year, as punishment for a past rebellion, the Capitol forces each district to send one boy and one girl to compete in the Hunger Games—a brutal, televised event where participants fight to the death until only one remains.</p>

            <h3>Key Themes in The Hunger Games</h3>
            <p>Survival: At its core, The Hunger Games is about survival in a hostile, oppressive world. Katniss's resourcefulness and determination highlight how far people are willing to go to protect themselves and their loved ones.
                Sacrifice: From Katniss volunteering to take her sister's place in the Games, to the sacrifices of other characters, the theme of selflessness runs deep throughout the series.
                Power and Control: The Capitol's manipulation of the districts through the Hunger Games is a commentary on the ways that power can be abused, and how those in control maintain their dominance over others.
                Rebellion: The story also touches on the power of collective resistance, as Katniss becomes an unwitting symbol of the revolution against the Capitol's oppressive regime.</p>
